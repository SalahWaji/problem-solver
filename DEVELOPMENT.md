# Problem Solver Platform - Development Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Problem Solver Platform, its current state, and guidance for future development.

## Project Overview

The Problem Solver Platform collects business problems from owners and operators, analyzes them using AI, and provides immediate value through personalized insights reports. The platform will eventually connect these problems with tech entrepreneurs looking for real-world challenges to solve.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features

- **Multi-step Submission Form**: Form for business owners to submit problems
- **Supabase Integration**: Database setup for storing submissions, reports, and admin notes
- **Admin Dashboard**: Basic dashboard to view and manage submissions
- **Submission Details**: Detailed view of each submission with notes functionality
- **API Structure**: Server-side API endpoints for secure database operations

### Partially Implemented Features

- **AI Analysis**: Structure for OpenAI integration is in place, but may need refinement
- **Email Delivery**: Placeholder implementation for SendGrid integration
- **Report Generation**: Basic structure for generating reports, but needs testing

### Not Yet Implemented

- **Analytics Dashboard**: KPIs and analytics for submissions
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering and search for submissions
- **User Authentication**: Proper authentication for admin users
- **PDF Report Generation**: Converting reports to downloadable PDFs
- **Entrepreneur Marketplace**: Future phase connecting problems with solution providers

## Project Structure

- `/components`: React components
- `/pages`: Next.js pages
  - `/admin`: Admin dashboard pages
  - `/api`: API endpoints
  - `/submit`: Submission form pages
- `/services`: Service modules
  - `ai.ts`: OpenAI integration
  - `email.ts`: Email delivery service
- `/styles`: Global styles
- `/types`: TypeScript type definitions

## Key API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

- `/api/submissions`: Handle form submissions
- `/api/test-supabase`: Test Supabase connection
- `/api/create-test-submission`: Create a test submission

### Admin Endpoints

- `/api/admin/get-submissions`: Fetch all submissions
- `/api/admin/get-submission`: Fetch a single submission
- `/api/admin/update-submission`: Update a submission's status

## Database Structure

The Supabase database has three main tables:

1. **submissions**: Stores all form submissions
   - Fields: id, industry, company_size, years_in_business, operational_area, problem_frequency, impact_severity, current_approaches, solution_satisfaction, budget_range, problem_description, document_url, email, opt_in_future, allow_follow_up, interested_in_discount, status, created_at, updated_at

2. **reports**: Stores AI-generated reports
   - Fields: id, submission_id, report_content, pdf_url, generated_at, delivered, delivered_at, created_at, updated_at

3. **admin_notes**: Stores admin notes for submissions
   - Fields: id, submission_id, note_content, admin_user, created_at

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password

# Base URL for API calls
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Roadmap

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Fix Report Generation**:
   - Test the OpenAI integration
   - Ensure reports are properly stored in the database
   - Verify the report display in the admin dashboard

2. **Implement Analytics**:
   - Create a new page at `/admin/analytics`
   - Add KPIs like total submissions, submissions by status, etc.
   - Add charts for submissions by industry, company size, etc.

3. **Complete Email Integration**:
   - Implement actual SendGrid integration
   - Create email templates for reports
   - Test email delivery

### Medium-term Tasks

1. **Improve Admin Dashboard**:
   - Add search functionality
   - Add pagination for submissions
   - Add sorting options

2. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement proper authentication for admin users
   - Add rate limiting for form submissions
   - Add CSRF protection

3. **Add PDF Generation**:
   - Generate PDF reports for submissions
   - Allow downloading of PDF reports
   - Store PDF URLs in the database

### Long-term Tasks

1. **Entrepreneur Marketplace**:
   - Create entrepreneur-facing pages
   - Implement matching algorithm
   - Add communication features

2. **Community Features**:
   - Add discussion forums
   - Implement upvoting system
   - Add commenting functionality

3. **Monetization**:
   - Implement subscription system
   - Add payment processing
   - Create premium features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase Connection Issues**:
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify Supabase project is active
   - Check RLS policies

2. **OpenAI Integration Issues**:
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Check rate limits
   - Ensure prompt format is correct

3. **Admin Dashboard Issues**:
   - Clear browser cache and local storage
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are working

### Debug Tools

- `/debug`: Page with tools to test Supabase connection and create test submissions
- `/api/test-supabase`: API endpoint to test Supabase connection
- Browser developer tools: Check console for errors

## Getting Started for New Developers

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
6. Access the admin dashboard at http://localhost:3000/admin (password: 123)
7. Use the debug page at http://localhost:3000/debug to test functionality

## Conclusion

The Problem Solver Platform is a work in progress with a solid foundation. The core functionality is in place, but there are still many features to implement and refine. This document should serve as a guide for future development.
